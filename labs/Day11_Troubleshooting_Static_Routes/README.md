## Objective:
Troubleshoot and fix static route misconfigurations to restore connectivity between PC1 and PC2.

## Scenario:
Three routers (R1, R2, R3) are statically configured, but PC1 and PC2 cannot ping each other. Each router has one misconfiguration.

## Troubleshooting Steps:
1. Verified interface IPs and interface status using `show ip interface brief`.
2. Used `show ip route` to check static routes.
3. Used `ping` to check connectivity.
4. Found and corrected misconfigurations in each router.

## Result:
Ping between PC1 and PC2 is successful after corrections .
