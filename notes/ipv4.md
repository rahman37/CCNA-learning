# IPv4 Addressing – Notes

## Classes
- Class A: 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
- Class B: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255
- Class C: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255

## Private IP Ranges
- 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (Class A)
- 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (Class B)
- 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (Class C)

## Key Concepts
- Network vs Host bits
- Subnet mask defines boundaries
- Broadcast address = last IP in the subnet
- Default gateway = router for outbound traffic
